## Why is this forked?

Originally, this was forked due to 2LStudios removing permanent links for downloads. However, recently they've also removed the free downloads and put the download links behind a BuiltByBit paywall. [linsaftw talks more about this here.](https://github.com/Permanently/FlameCord/commit/9f61fee97f1de2ed44965e6092bb9bf3dd117646#commitcomment-101015673) I've added them back for those who (unfortunately) are not able to support 2LStudios financially, as their licensing allows this. 

If you would like to support 2LStudios (I recommend it) then you may use the links on the original readme.md below this section.
